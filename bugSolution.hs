```haskell
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.Ord (comparing)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, "2", 3, 4, 5]
  -- This will result in a runtime error
  -- print (sort xs)

  -- Solution:  Use comparing to sort based on a specific field or type.
  let ys = sortOn show xs
  print ys

  -- Alternative Solution: Using sortBy for more complex comparison logic
  let zs = sortBy (
    x y -> case (x,y) of
            (a, b) | isNumber a && isNumber b -> compare a b
                  | otherwise -> compare (show x) (show y)
  ) xs
  print zs
  where
    isNumber x = case reads x :: [(Integer,String)] of
                 [] -> False
                 _ -> True
